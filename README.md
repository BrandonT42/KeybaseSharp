# KeybaseSharp
A .NET wrapper to around the Keybase API (keybase + c sharp => KeybaseSharp, clever I know, I'm sooo proud of myself).

## Work in progress
As you see, there is not much yet (understatement!), but I'm working on this in my spare time (of which I have little). But I'll do my best to keep this project going. Good thing I don't have much followers.

## Different versions get different branches
For each branch of the API, there will be a branch in this project. Example: api-v1.0 is used for API version 1.0.
