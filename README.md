# KeybaseSharp
A .NET wrapper to around the Keybase API (KeybaseSharp, because CSharp, clever I know, I'm sooo proud of myself).

## Work in progress
As you see, there is not much yet (understatement!), but I'm working on this in my spare time (of which I have little). But I'll do my best to keep this project going. Good thing I don't have much followers.
